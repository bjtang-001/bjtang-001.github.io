Welcome! I‚Äôm **Dr. Bijun Tang**, a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at the School of Materials Science and Engineering, **Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore**, and a former visiting scientist at **Rice University**. I received my **BEng (First Class Honours)** and **PhD** from NTU in 2017 and 2021.

My research focuses on the **synthesis and engineering of novel 2D materials**, and the development of **AI-driven platforms** for intelligent materials discovery and optimization. I work at the intersection of **materials science** and **artificial intelligence**, aiming to accelerate the design and synthesis of advanced materials through data and automation.

I have authored over **30 peer-reviewed publications** in top-tier journals, including *Nature*, *Nature Materials*, *Nature Electronics*, *Nature Communications*, *Advanced Materials*, and *Materials Today*, with an **H-index of 19** and **1800+ citations**. I‚Äôve also led and co-led several large-scale research projects with total funding exceeding **S$5 million**.
