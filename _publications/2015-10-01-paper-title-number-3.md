We present a machine learning-driven synthesis pipeline that tailors the optical properties of carbon quantum dots, achieving precise color tuning and high quantum yields. This work demonstrates how explainable models and synthesis optimization can be combined to enable data-driven design of advanced fluorescent nanomaterials.
