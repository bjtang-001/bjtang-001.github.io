## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m **Dr. Bijun Tang**, a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at the School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. I also spent time as a visiting scientist at Rice University, USA. I earned both my BEng (First Class Honours) and PhD from NTU in 2017 and 2021.

**My work sits at the exciting intersection of materials science and artificial intelligence (AI)**. Iâ€™m passionate about developing AI-driven tools and platforms to make the discovery and synthesis of new materials faster, smarter, and more efficient. While I focus a lot on 2D materials, my research also spans a range of low-dimensional and high-performance materials such as 0D nanoparticles, 1D nanoribbons, as well as 3D alloys and composites.

Iâ€™ve published over **40 peer-reviewed articles** in leading journals like *Nature*, *Nature Materials*, *Nature Electronics*, *Nature Communications*, *Advanced Materials*, and *Materials Today*. My work has been cited more than 2,100 times, and I currently have an H-index of 23. I've led and co-led several major projects in **AI for Materials Science (AI4MS)**, with total research funding exceeding S$6 million.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Interests

My research blends deep materials knowledge with cutting-edge AI techniques. I'm especially interested in:

- Creating and studying **low-dimensional materials** (like 2D sheets, 1D ribbons, and 0D dots) for various applications such as electronics and catalysis  
- Using **AI to guide the design and synthesis** of new materials, from **0D quantum dots** to **2D materials** and now to **3D alloys**  
- Applying **data-driven methods** for phase control, property optimization, and multi-objective material design  
- Building **autonomous and explainable AI systems** to speed up materials development with less trial and error

At the heart of it all, I'm working toward a future where discovering and making new materials becomes faster, more intelligent, and more insightful.
