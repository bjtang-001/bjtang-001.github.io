## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m **Dr. Bijun Tang**, a **Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow** at the **School of Materials Science and Engineering**, **Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore**. I also spent time as a visiting scientist at **Rice University**, USA. I earned both my **BEng (First Class Honours)** and **PhD** from NTU in 2017 and 2021.

My work sits at the exciting intersection of **materials science** and **artificial intelligence (AI)**. Iâ€™m passionate about developing **AI-driven tools and platforms** to make the discovery and synthesis of new materials faster, smarter, and more efficient. While I focus a lot on **2D materials**, my research also spans a range of low-dimensional and high-performance materials such as 1D nanoribbons and 0D nanoparticles.

Iâ€™ve published over **30 peer-reviewed articles** in leading journals like *Nature*, *Nature Materials*, *Nature Electronics*, *Nature Communications*, *Advanced Materials*, and *Materials Today*. My work has been cited more than **1,800 times**, and I currently have an **H-index of 19**. I've led and co-led several major projects in **AI for Materials Science (AI4MS)**, with total research funding exceeding **S$5 million**.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Interests

My research blends deep materials knowledge with cutting-edge AI techniques. I'm especially interested in:

- Creating and studying **low-dimensional materials** (like 2D sheets, 1D ribbons, and 0D dots) for electronics and catalysis  
- Using **AI to guide the design and synthesis** of new materials, from **2D materials** to **3D alloys**  
- Applying **data-driven methods** for phase control, property optimization, and multi-objective material design  
- Building **autonomous and explainable AI systems** to speed up materials development with less trial and error

At the heart of it all, I'm working toward a future where discovering and making new materials becomes faster, more intelligent, and more insightful.
